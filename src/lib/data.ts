  heroDescription:
    "As someone transitioning into software development, I bring a fresh perspective rooted in curiosity, adaptability, and a passion for solving real-world problems. My background in customer service — drawn from my experience in retail and as an electrician — has equipped me with strong communication, problem-solving, and collaboration skills. I've developed the ability to understand user needs, resolve conflicts, and deliver solutions that prioritize clarity and accessibility. I thrive in cross-functional environments, where I consistently demonstrate the ability to learn quickly, adapt to new technologies, and contribute to mission-driven teams. My goal is to grow in a mentorship-driven environment where I can create innovative projects that prioritize accessibility, performance, and meaningful impact."

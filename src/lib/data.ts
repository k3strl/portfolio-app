I've developed the ability to understand user needs, resolve conflicts, and deliver solutions that prioritize clarity and accessibility. I thrive in cross-functional environments, where I consistently demonstrate the ability to learn quickly, adapt to new technologies, and contribute to mission-driven teams. My goal is to grow in a mentorship-driven environment where I can create innovative projects that prioritize accessibility, performance, and meaningful impact.",
